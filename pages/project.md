# Pronunciation Analysis Project: Graduate-Level Final Assignment

This project involves analyzing the English pronunciation of Korean learners using authentic student recordings. A total of 4 learner recordings will be provided and each student will be assigned **one audio file to focus on**. Your goal is to provide a **diagnostic analysis** with **instructional feedback**. This project draws on knowledge from your phonology course and should apply both **segmental** and **suprasegmental** frameworks.

## 🎯 Project Overview

- **Task**: 1) Analyze one Korean learner’s English pronunciation using the checklist below. 2) Include a comparative analysis by referring to the three audio files in addition to the focus audio.
- **Goal**: Identify common errors, provide phonetic descriptions/(additional) explanations, and offer pedagogical suggestions for the target English learner.
- **Deliverables**:
  1. A **brief written report** (2–3 pages): by Nov.27
  2. A **short in-class presentation** (10-15 minutes): during the final week

## ✅ Pronunciation Checklist for Korean Learners of English

### 1. Segmental Features

#### A. Consonant-Related Issues

| Feature | Description | Examples |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **/f/ and /v/** Substitution | Mispronounced as /p/ and /b/ | *fan* → [pæn], *van* → [bæn] |
| **/θ/ and /ð/** Substitution | Replaced with /s/, /d/, /t/, /z/ | *think* → [sɪŋk]; *this* → [dɪs] |

#### B. Vowel-Related Issues

| Feature | Description | Examples |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Lax vs. Tense** | Lack of tense-lax distinction | *ship* vs. *sheep* both as [ʃip] |
| **R-colored Vowels** | vowel + /r/ in American English | *turn* → r-dropping|
| **Diphthong Simplification** | Monophthongization of diphthongs | *go* → [go] |
| **/æ/ vs. /ɛ/** | Low-front vowel confusion | *bat* → [bɛt] |
| **Lack of Schwa Reduction** | Schwa pronounced as full vowel | *banana* → [ba.na.na] |

### 2. Suprasegmental Features

#### A. Word Stress

| Feature | Description | Examples |

| **Overarticulation of Unstressed Syllables** | No vowel reduction | *banana* → [bænænæ] |

#### B. Sentence Stress & Accenting

#### C. Intonation

| Feature | Description | Examples |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Rising/Falling Misuse** | Unnatural pitch contours | Statement said with rising tone |

## 📝 Report Guidelines (Due Before Presentation)

Your written report should include the following sections:

1. **Title**: Learner pseudonym or audio file name.
2. **Introduction**: Brief background on English pronunciation challenges for Korean learners.
3. **Error Analysis**:
   - Use the **checklist above** to describe key pronunciation issues.
   - Include **IPA transcriptions** where possible.
   - Organize your analysis clearly: Segmental → Suprasegmental.
4. **Phonological Explanations**:
   - Apply relevant phonological concepts (e.g., aspiration, vowel length, stress rules).
   - Reference rules covered in the phonology course.
5. **Pedagogical Suggestions**:
   - Suggest practical feedback the learner could use.
   - Recommend tools, practice tasks, or instructional tips.
6. **Conclusion**: Summary of strengths, weaknesses, and main articulatory points to improve.

> 📌 *Length: Around 2-3 pages (typed, single-spaced, clear section headings)*

## Final Presentation Guidelines

You will present your analysis to the class with slides or handouts. Your presentation should include:

- Introduction to the learner (no real names)
- Audio sample (if available)
- Key pronunciation patterns and errors
- Visuals (IPA, waveform, spectrogram – optional)
- Phonological rules you applied
- Practical feedback and teaching ideas

> ⏱️ *Time limit: 10 - 15 minutes. Be concise and clear.*

## 🧾 Submission

- **Written Report**: Submit via LMS or Google Drive folder before your presentation (11/27).
- **Presentation Video**: To be announced (final week).

## 🌀 Tip

Good pronunciation instruction is not about perfection but about **intelligibility** and **pedagogical clarity**. Show that you understand the learner’s needs and propose **realistic, well-informed solutions**.
