# Pronunciation Analysis Project: Graduate-Level Final Assignment

This project involves analyzing the English pronunciation of Korean learners using authentic student recordings. Each student will be assigned **one audio file**, and your goal is to provide a **diagnostic analysis** with **instructional feedback**. This project draws on knowledge from your phonology course and should apply both **segmental** and **suprasegmental** frameworks.

---

## 🎯 Project Overview

- **Task**: Analyze one Korean learner’s English pronunciation using the checklist below.
- **Goal**: Identify common errors, provide phonetic descriptions/(additional) explanations, and offer pedagogical suggestions.
- **Deliverables**:
  1. A **brief written report** (2–3 pages): by Nov.27
  2. A **short in-class presentation** (10-15 minutes): during the final week

## ✅ Pronunciation Checklist for Korean Learners of English

### 1. 🧩 Segmental Features

#### A. Consonant-Related Issues

| Feature | Description | Examples |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Voicing Contrast** | Voiced/voiceless pairs not distinguished clearly | /b/ vs. /p/, /d/ vs. /t/, /g/ vs. /k/ |
| **Final Consonant Deletion** | Omission of final stops or nasals | *dog* → [dɑ] |
| **Aspiration Errors** | Over/under-aspiration in word-initial voiceless stops | *pen* → [bɛn] |
| **Consonant Cluster Simplification** | Insertion of vowel or deletion in clusters | *spring* → [sɯ.pɹɪŋ] |
| **/f/ and /v/** Substitution | Mispronounced as /p/ and /b/ | *fan* → [pæn], *van* → [bæn] |
| **/θ/ and /ð/** Substitution | Replaced with /s/, /d/, /t/, /z/ | *think* → [sɪŋk]; *this* → [dɪs] |
| **/r/ and /l/** Confusion | Substitution or misarticulation, especially in coda | *light* vs. *right* |
| **Glide Insertion or Deletion** | Unintended [j] or [w]; missing glides | *old* → [owld], *you* → [u] |
| **Glottalization** | Glottal stop replaces final consonant | *cat* → [kæʔ] |
| **Lack of Flapping** | No flapping between vowels | *butter* → [ˈbʌtər] instead of [ˈbʌɾər] |
| **Dark /l/** | Velarized /l/ in coda not produced | *feel* → [fi.l] instead of [fi.ɫ] |

#### B. Vowel-Related Issues

| Feature | Description | Examples |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Vowel Length** | Lack of tense-lax distinction | *ship* vs. *sheep* both as [ʃip] |
| **Lax vs. Tense** | Confusion between /ɪ/ and /i/, /ʊ/ and /u/ | *bit* vs. *beat* |
| **Central Vowels** | /ə/, /ʌ/, /ɜː/ not clearly distinguished | *cup* → [kɔp] |
| **Diphthong Simplification** | Monophthongization of diphthongs | *ride* → [rad] |
| **/æ/ vs. /ɛ/** | Low-front vowel confusion | *bat* → [bɛt] |
| **Vowel Insertion (Epenthesis)** | Unwanted vowels added between consonants | *black* → [bɯ.læk] |
| **/ɔ/ vs. /ɑ/** | Merged vowels due to lack of /ɔ/ in Korean | *cot* = *caught* |
| **Lack of Schwa Reduction** | Schwa pronounced as full vowel | *banana* → [bæ.næ.næ] |

---

### 2. 📏 Suprasegmental Features

#### A. Word Stress

| Feature | Description | Examples |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Incorrect Primary Stress** | Misplaced stress in polysyllabic words | *record* (noun vs. verb), *photograph* vs. *photography* |
| **Overarticulation of Unstressed Syllables** | No vowel reduction | *banana* → [bænænæ] |

#### B. Sentence Stress & Accenting

| Feature | Description | Examples |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Contrastive Stress Misuse** | Incorrect emphasis on contrast | *I said GREEN tea, not BLACK tea* |
| **Function Word Emphasis** | Equal stress on all words | *He is going to the store* said robotically |
| **No Content-Function Distinction** | Flat or unnatural prominence | Monotone delivery |

#### C. Intonation

| Feature | Description | Examples |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Rising/Falling Misuse** | Unnatural pitch contours | Statement said with rising tone |
| **Wh- vs. Yes/No Questions** | Incorrect intonation patterns | *What are you doing?* with rising tone |
| **Tag Questions** | Inappropriate final rise/fall | *It's nice, isn't it?* with rising instead of falling |

#### D. Thought Grouping / Pausing

| Feature | Description | Examples |
|--------|-------------|----------|
| **Lack of Chunking** | No grouping of meaning units | *When I was young / I lived in Seoul* becomes flat |
| **Unnatural Pausing** | Pauses at wrong places | *I / want to go home* |

## 📝 Report Guidelines (Due Before Presentation)

Your written report should include the following sections:

1. **Title**: Learner pseudonym or audio file name.
2. **Introduction**: Brief background on English pronunciation challenges for Korean learners.
3. **Error Analysis**:
   - Use the **checklist above** to describe key pronunciation issues.
   - Include **IPA transcriptions** where possible.
   - Organize your analysis clearly: Segmental → Suprasegmental.
4. **Phonological Explanations**:
   - Apply relevant phonological concepts (e.g., aspiration, vowel length, stress rules).
   - Reference rules covered in the phonology course.
5. **Pedagogical Suggestions**:
   - Suggest practical feedback the learner could use.
   - Recommend tools, practice tasks, or instructional tips.
6. **Conclusion**: Summary of strengths, weaknesses, and main teaching points.

> 📌 *Length: Around 1–2 pages (typed, double-spaced, clear section headings)*

## 🎤 Final Presentation Guidelines

You will present your analysis to the class with slides or handouts. Your presentation should include:

- Introduction to the learner (no real names)
- Audio sample (if available)
- Key pronunciation patterns and errors
- Visuals (IPA, waveform, spectrogram – optional)
- Phonological rules you applied
- Practical feedback and teaching ideas

> ⏱️ *Time limit: 7–10 minutes. Be concise and clear.*

---

## 🧾 Submission

- **Written Report**: Submit via LMS or Google Drive folder before your presentation.
- **Presentation Slides**: Optional to submit in advance, but encouraged.

Let me know if you have questions about tools (e.g., Audacity, Praat, ELAN), transcription, or formatting.

## 🧠 Tip

Good pronunciation instruction is not about perfection but about **intelligibility** and **pedagogical clarity**. Show that you understand the learner’s needs and propose **realistic, well-informed solutions**.
